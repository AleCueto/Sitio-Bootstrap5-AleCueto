# Sitio-Bootstrap5-AleCueto
## This repository is for a school work that consists in making a landing page using styles from bootstrap v5.
Most of the work here done comes from the official page https://getbootstrap.com/
The mechanism is basic, I have used the stylesheet and javascript functions from bootstrap framework and editing my html code i have created a complete landing page.
